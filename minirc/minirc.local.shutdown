# Windows 7 bug workaround
# Rebooting from Arch to Windows 7 leaves ethernet adapter in an unusable state
# blacklist r8168 and r8169 in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
# r8169 is also blacklisted in /usr/lib/modprobe.d/r8168-lts.conf (provided by r8168-lts package)
# on boot r8169 is modprobed manually by minirc.local
# on shutdown drop r8169 and modprobe r8168 which leaves the card in a usable state
# r8168 is unstable for normal use (drops when used with VirtualBox)
